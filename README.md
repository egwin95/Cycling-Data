## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

## 1. Ask
  **BUSINESS TASK: Analyze Cyclistic data to determine how Casual and Members are using the service and what steps can be made to bring casual customers in as members by using digital media methods.
  
 Primary Stakeholders: Lily Moreno
 Secondary Stakeholders: Cyclistic marketing analytics team, Cyclistic executive team
 
## 2. Prepare
Data Source: Cyclistic's historical trip data over the last 12 months

The dataset has 13 CSV files, this data follows the ROCCC approach:

- Reliability: The data is from Cyclistic's historical trip data, this data is based off public access to the Bike-Share company and determines trip time based on where the bike was docked.
-  Original: Data is taken from the Bike-Share company
-  Comprehensive: Data is taken at an hourly level, when bikes are checked out, checked in or docked the data is updated with latitude and longitude of the starting and ending station the bike was docked at.
-  Current: Data is from 2022 and tracks data over the course of each month
-  Cited: Cyclistic

## 3. Process

Data cleaning was done using SQL in Google BigQuery, these initial steps are queries used to prepare the data for cleaning. First step was to take all twelve CSV files and combine them into one large database
```
CREATE TABLE Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata AS
SELECT *
FROM (
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_January
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_February
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_March
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_April
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_May
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_June
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_July
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_August
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_September
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_October
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_November
     UNION ALL 
     SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.Tripdata_December
     );
```

Used DISTINCT on ride_id so no further cleaning was necessary, then used another query to determine the different ride_types:
```
SELECT DISTINCT rideable_type
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata;
```
Next step was to perform a check on started_at and ended_at data sets to make sure rides that are greater than one minute and less than twenty-four hours are shown in our results:
```
SELECT *
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata
WHERE TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) <= 1 OR
   TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) >= 1440;
```
Next I checked for any naming errors for start_station name and ID and end_station name and ID:
```
SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(*)
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY start_station_name;

SELECT end_station_name, COUNT(*)
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata
GROUP BY end_station_name
ORDER BY end_station_name;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(start_station_name)) AS startName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(end_station_name)) AS endName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(start_station_id)) AS startID,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(end_station_id)) AS endID,
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata;
```
For this step I checked for the amount of rows that had NULL values, these rows will be removed later during our cleaning query set:
```
SELECT rideable_type, count(*) as num_of_rides
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata
WHERE start_station_name IS NULL AND start_station_id IS NULL OR
    end_station_name IS NULL AND end_station_id IS NULL 
GROUP BY rideable_type;
```
NULLS in start_lat/lng and end_lat/lng:
```
SELECT * FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata
WHERE start_lat IS NULL OR
      start_lng IS NULL OR
      end_lat IS NULL OR
      end_lng IS NULL;
```
Last pre-cleaning step is to verify that there are only two member types in the member_casual column:
```
SELECT DISTINCT member_casual
FROM cycling-tripdata-2022.Tripdata_2022.combined_tripdata;
```
